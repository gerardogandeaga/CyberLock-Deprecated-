        Cyber Lock is a mobile application designed to secure and privatize your personal information.
        Cyber Lock is equipped to utilize four different symmetric Encryption Algorithms; AES, Blowfish,
        RC4 and Triple DES. Pins are protected using a salted SHA-256 algorithm, a powerful one-way
        hash function that cannot be decrypted.
        \n\n
        <b>AES</b>\n\n
        Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a newer and stronger encryption standard, which uses
        the Rijndael algorithm. This algorithm was developed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen of
        Belgium. AES has a block size of 128 and is able to use 128, 192, and 256-bit keys for
        powerful encryption.
        \n\n
        <b>Blowfish</b>\n\n
        Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher, designed by Bruce Schneier.
        Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 32 up to 448 bits.
        \n\n
        <b>SHA-256</b>\n\n
        SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm), a cryptographic function which takes an input and spits
        out an alphanumeric string. SHA-256 generates an almost-unique, fixed 256-bit hash. A hash
        is a one way function “encryptor” which cannot be decrypted. SHA-256 is currently one of
        the strongest functions available.
